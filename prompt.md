 we are building a b2b ecommerce portal. We have buyers and sellers roles. Each have their own portal and signup process. Buyers will use the main signup flow. we need to build an onboarding flow to ensure they a a valid business. We also need to build a signup and onboarding for sellers. There is a brands page that will be the starting point for sellers.


We need to collect the following as part of the signup. Feel free to add/improve this as required:

Buyers:
Business:
- Business Name
- Email
- website
- Location (city)

Contact:
- Name
- Email
- Phone

Company:
- Trade license number
- VAT TRN number


Sellers:

Brand:
- Brand name
- Store name
- Primary Category

Business:
- Business Name
- Logo
- Email
- website
- Address (city, state, country)
- Base currency

When the onboarding is complete, the account goes into pending state untill the admin approved the account. The users should still be able to login but should only see a sticky popup showing pwnding approval.
