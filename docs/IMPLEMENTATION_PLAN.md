## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
```
main
  ├── develop
  │   ├── feature/user-auth
  │   ├── feature/product-management
  │   └── feature/order-system
  └── release/v1.0
```

### Code Review Process
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request
4. Code review by team
5. Merge to develop after approval
6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge to main for production

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for both frontend and backend
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API testing
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: JMeter or K6
- **Security Tests**: OWASP ZAP

## API Structure

### RESTful Endpoints
```

## Database Schema

### Collections Structure
```javascript
Users {
  _id, email, password, role, status,
  profile: { firstName, lastName, company },
  verification: { documents, approvedAt }
}

Products {
  _id, seller, name, category, 
  variants: [{ sku, price, inventory }],
  status, visibility
}

Orders {
  _id, buyer, seller, items, 
  status, payment, shipping,
  total, createdAt
}

RFQs {

```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data
- HTTPS only in production
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- SQL injection prevention

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- PCI DSS for payment processing
- Data retention policies
- Privacy policy implementation
- Terms of service
